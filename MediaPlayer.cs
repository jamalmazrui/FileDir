// MediaPlayer.cs -- the Homer Player dialog.
//
// WHAT IT IS
//
// A dialog that plays a queue of tracks. mpv does the playing, with no window,
// no keys and no focus of its own; every control here is an ordinary Windows
// control and each one becomes a command down mpv's pipe. Mpv.cs is that
// plumbing.
//
// THE LAYOUT
//
//   Tracks     the queue: name, presenter and length
//   Order      how the queue is sorted, then Next and Previous
//   Forward    Backward, and the Increment slider those two move by
//   Rate       and Volume
//   Go         Stop, Help, Close
//
// Five rows, each holding the controls that belong together, so Tab goes from
// a thing to the things that act on it rather than past the whole dialog.
//
// NAMES
//
// Not one control here has its AccessibleName set. A button carries its caption
// and a list carries the label above it, and setting the property to the same
// words makes some screen readers say them twice. Colons follow the labels that
// are separate controls -- Tracks, Order, Increment, Rate, Volume -- and never
// the buttons, which carry their own captions.
//
// SPEECH
//
// The reader announces the dialog, the control with focus, the list line under
// the cursor and a slider's value as it moves, so none of that is spoken here.
// What is spoken is what the reader cannot know: the track when playback moves
// on by itself, the position after a jump, the end of the queue.
//
// Speech goes out as global, which bypasses FileDir's Scroll Lock silence.
// That is deliberate: Scroll Lock is this dialog's play and pause key, so half
// the time it is on, and a player that fell silent on every other press of its
// own pause key would be unusable.

// pads because both send the same keys. Bare navigation belongs to whatever
// control has focus -- the Track list is read with it -- and Control with those
// keys belongs to the dialog itself, where Control+Home and Control+End move to

// select and nothing to tag, and a single-selection list does nothing with
