// Media.cs -- finding and running ExifTool, ffmpeg and ffprobe, for Homer Tools.

//
// WHAT THIS IS FOR
//
// ExifTool reads and writes the metadata inside a file: the camera that took a
// photograph, the artist and album of a song, the duration and codecs of a
// video, the author and producer of a PDF. It knows thousands of tags across
// hundreds of formats, which is why FileDir asks it rather than parsing any of
// those formats itself.
//
// ffmpeg and ffprobe are here for the same reason and are located the same way.
//
// This code is adapted from HomerScribe, which uses ExifTool to write picture
// descriptions. The finding is the hard part and HomerScribe already solved it;
// what each program does with the tool afterwards differs.
//
// WHY EVERY CANDIDATE IS RUN RATHER THAN GUESSED AT
//
// HomerScribe's note is worth keeping whole: a copy installed with winget sat
// alongside an older one in the build folder, and the question "which will be
// used" could not be answered by looking. So every likely place is tried, each
// candidate is RUN to learn its version, and all of them are recorded with the
// choice and the reason. The log then answers that question without anybody
// going to look.
//
// ONE DIFFERENCE FROM HOMERSCRIBE
//
// HomerScribe insists on a single-file ExifTool, because a packaged one --
// a small launcher plus an "exiftool_files" folder holding Perl -- complicates
// what it has to ship. FileDir only READS, so a packaged copy works perfectly
// well and is accepted. A single file beside FileDir.exe is still preferred,
// and the log says which was chosen.
